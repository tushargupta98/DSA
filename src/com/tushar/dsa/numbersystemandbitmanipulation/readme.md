Notes:
1. Computers understands Binary Numbers
2. Three Important Operations
   1. AND Operation = &
   2. OR Operation = |
   3. XOR Operation = ^
3. examples
   1. For Two numbers a=4=[1,0,0] b=3=[0,1,1] {Decimal and Binary Representation Respectively}
      1. [4] AND [3] = [1,0,0] AND [0,1,1] = [0,0,0] = 0
      2. [4] OR [3] = [1,0,0] OR [0,1,1] = [1,1,1] = 7
      3. [4] XOR [3] = [1,0,0] XOR [0,1,1] = [1,1,1] = 7
   2. a&b&c = a&c&b = b&a&c = c&b&a = c&a&b = b&c&a
   3. a^a = b^b = c^c = 0
   4. a^a^b^b^c = c
